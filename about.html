            <h4>Our founder, Eduardo Torres, valued the special properties a letter had on a reader. <img src=https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Frunrun.es%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F05%2Feduardo-torres.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=31a1bdd1ad3d5c6b9623c1e944425dc4422629a040222b8ee2612f230af2ad90alt="letter" width="40" height="28"></h4>
<p1>	<pre>   
    Letters are novel, and command our attention when we read. 
Seeing our friend's handwriting can even asist us in hearing 
their voice in our mind. To help make this more personal way 
of communicating as easy as possible we decided to start 
this company! </pre></p1>

-CSC391-A01---HTML-Individual-Webpage

I used the requirements for teams 1 and 5. To do this I made up a fake company who sends letters to people for you. 
All you have to do is send them the message you want to send, the address where you want it to go, and pick the 
options for envelope, paper, writing utencil, ect. that you want and the company handles the rest!

Clickable checkmark code taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/how-to-create-an-html-checkbox-with-a-clickable-label/.

Used https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_col.asp to help understand tags and to use their online html editor to preview changes before putting them into VScode.

Credit also to Joseph Racca and Eljay Jimenez, for working with me for the team project and helping me to learn HTML.
I used our team website as the base for my individual one, altering everything to make it my own.
